# This is a React Application which utilizes the main React functionalities (simple and more complex).

## React topics used:

- useEffect/useState
- React Router, useNavigate, useLocation, loader
- useCallback, memo
- useReducer
- useQuery
- useRef
- React Portals
- Generic Component (FormInput)
- Redux Toolkit, selectors, actions, reducers, async thunk
- Custom hooks

## Non-react good practices:

- Custom Axios instance
- Good folder structure
- ESLint
- Nested CSS
- Implementing functionality of a library (react-hot-toast) from scratch and removing the library
- Dialog modal
